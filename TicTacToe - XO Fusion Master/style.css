/*The Tic Tac Toe app provides two gameplay modes: 2 Player Mode and Player vs. Computer Mode.

In 2 Player Mode, pls disable the working of the computer logic when 2 player mode is clicked that means it is the game between 2 human users not the human and computer logic did u understand and it's a turn-based game between the two human players.

In Player vs. Computer Mode, the user plays against the computer. The computer logic attempts to win the game. The user can choose their player character (X or O), and the computer automatically selects the opposite character.

The game should feature always the best version of styling to enhance the user experience.

The script ensures that the game functions correctly based on the described requirements for both gameplay modes.

use box icons for appealing Ui / UX and Pls implement the dark and night mode with fa fa icons and work more efficiently styling colors in dark mode and it should be positioned some where else

at last  before giving the output pls verify my request twice  just focus on important aspects  of my request and if you have any doubt pls ask and also if you can add more enhanced features for this web app  pls add them provide the entire code so that i can just copy it*/
